<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    I'm a web developer with a strong sense of structure and usability. My background includes not only frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but also an understanding of UI/UX principles and accessibility.
</p>
<p>
    I enjoy transforming design into responsive, semantic interfaces and continuously learning new patterns and frameworks to improve my workflow.
